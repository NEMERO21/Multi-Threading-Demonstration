# Multi-Threading-Demonstration


This repository contains code for analyzing the performance of matrix multiplication using multiple threads. It calculates the average time taken for matrix multiplication with different numbers of threads, plots the execution time graph, and monitors CPU usage.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/matrix-multiplication-analysis.git

2. Install dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook matrix_multiplication_analysis.ipynb.
2. Run each cell sequentially to execute the code and generate results.
3. View the result table, execution time graph, and CPU usage graph.

## Files

1. threading.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for analysis.
2. requirements.txt: File listing all required Python packages and their versions.
